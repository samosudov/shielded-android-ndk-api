* ❌ We **do not** undertake appropriate security coverage (threat models, review, response, etc.).
* :heavy_check_mark: There is a product manager for this library.
* :heavy_check_mark: Electric Coin Company maintains the library as we discover bugs and do network upgrades/minor releases.
* :heavy_check_mark: Users can expect to get a response within a few weeks after submitting an issue.
* ❌ The User Support team **has not yet been briefed** on the features provided to users and the functionality of the associated test-framework.

### 🛑 Use of this code may lead to a loss of funds 🛑

Use of this code in its current form or with modifications may lead to loss of funds, loss
of "expected" privacy, or denial of service for a large portion of users, or a bug which
could leverage any of those kinds of attacks (especially a "0 day" where we suspect few
people know about the vulnerability).

### :eyes: At this time, this is for preview purposes only. :eyes:
